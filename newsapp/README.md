# Pulse - AI-Powered Personalized News App

A mobile-first news application inspired by Artifact that uses Claude AI to learn your preferences, categorize content, and deliver a personalized reading experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Claude API analyzes your reading habits to recommend content you'll love
- **Swipe Interface**: Tinder-style card swiping for quick article discovery
  - Swipe right to like
  - Swipe left to skip
  - Tap save button to bookmark
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic topic detection and content classification
- **AI Summaries**: Claude generates concise 2-sentence summaries of articles
- **Preference Learning**: System learns from your interactions to improve recommendations over time

### User Interface

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for smartphones and tablets
- **Multiple Views**:
  - **For You**: Personalized article feed
  - **Explore**: Browse by topic and see trending stories
  - **Insights**: Track your reading habits and interests
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support
- **Responsive**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes

### Personalization Engine

The app tracks and learns from:
- Articles you like/dislike
- Topics you engage with
- Reading frequency and patterns
- Time spent on different content types

The personalization algorithm:
1. Assigns scores to different topics based on your interactions
2. Ranks articles using a weighted scoring system
3. Balances personalization with discovery to avoid echo chambers
4. Prioritizes recent content while respecting your preferences

## Claude API Integration

### Features Using Claude API:

1. **Article Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of long articles
2. **Content Categorization**: Automatically identifies topics and keywords
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines article tone and sentiment
4. **Preference Analysis**: Analyzes your reading patterns to suggest new topics

### API Setup

1. Get your Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Open the app and click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
3. Enter your API key in the "API Key" field
4. Save settings

**Note**: The app works without an API key using fallback methods, but Claude integration provides significantly better summaries and categorization.

### API Usage

The app uses the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model with efficient token usage:
- Summaries: ~200 tokens per article
- Categorization: ~100 tokens per article
- Preference analysis: ~150 tokens per session

API calls are made only when:
- Auto-summarize is enabled (can be toggled off)
- You have an API key configured
- An article hasn't been summarized before (cached locally)

## Installation & Usage

2. Select your initial interests
3. Start swiping through personalized content!

- LocalStorage persistence for preferences and stats
- Reactive UI updates based on state changes

**PersonalizationEngine**
- Calculates article relevance scores

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage:

- **User Preferences**: Interests, liked/disliked articles, API key
- **Reading Stats**: Articles read, streaks, reading history
- **Topic Scores**: Learned preferences for different topics
- **Settings**: Display preferences, feature toggles

**Privacy**: All data stays on your device. The API key is stored locally and never shared except with Anthropic's API.

## Customization

### Adding New Topics

Edit the topics array in `app.js`:

```javascript
const topics = [
    { name: 'Your Topic', icon: 'üìå', topic: 'your-topic' },
    // ...
];
```

### Integrating Real News API

Replace `SAMPLE_ARTICLES` with API calls:

```javascript
async function fetchArticles() {
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_NEWS_API');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.articles;
}
```

Recommended news APIs:
- NewsAPI.org
- New York Times API
- Guardian API
- Reddit RSS feeds

### Adjusting Personalization

Tune the scoring algorithm in `PersonalizationEngine.calculateArticleScore()`:

```javascript
// Adjust these weights:
score += topicScore * 10;  // Topic affinity weight
score += 5;                // Interest boost
score += Math.random() * 2; // Randomness factor
```

## Advanced Features

### Reading Streaks

The app tracks consecutive days of reading to encourage engagement:
- Updates automatically when you read articles
- Displayed in the Insights view
- Persists across sessions

### Topic Score System

Each topic gets a score from -1 to 1:
- **Positive scores**: Topics you engage with
- **Negative scores**: Topics you skip
- **Zero**: Neutral/unexplored topics

Scores update incrementally:
- +0.1 for likes
- -0.05 for skips

### Smart Feed Ranking

Articles are ranked by:
1. Topic affinity (40% weight)
2. Selected interests (25% weight)
3. Recency (25% weight)
4. Randomness (10% weight - prevents filter bubble)
