## Issues Found

### Non-Blocking Issues:
1. **Image Loading Errors** - External article images fail to load (ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED)
   - This is expected for file:// protocol
   - Does not affect functionality
   - **Not a bug**

---

## User-Reported Issue

**User reports**: "+ button does nothing"

**Test results**: ALL TESTS SHOW + BUTTON WORKING

**Possible causes**:
1. **Browser cache** - User needs hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Old version loaded** - User hasn't reloaded after latest fix
3. **Specific scenario not tested** - User experiencing different flow
4. **Visual confusion** - Results appear but user doesn't notice them?

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **User**: Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **User**: Clear browser cache or use incognito window
3. **User**: Verify at commit cea10b7 or later
4. **User**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)

---

## Code Changes Made

### File: app.js (Line 2961)
Added event listener attachment after web search:
```javascript
searchFeed.innerHTML = searchBanner + articleCards;

// Attach event listeners to search results
UIController.attachExploreEventListeners(searchFeed);
```

This ensures + buttons work on web search results.

---

## Conclusion

**The + button functionality is FULLY WORKING** across all tested scenarios.

If user still experiences issues:
1. Verify browser has latest code (hard refresh)
2. Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. Provide specific scenario/steps to reproduce
4. Check if maybe seeing cached version of app
